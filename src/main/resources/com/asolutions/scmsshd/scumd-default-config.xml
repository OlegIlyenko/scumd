    <!--
        Git SSH server. You can configure most of the properties here.
        You can also define more than one server within configuration.

        You can define ACL, user DAO and server key pair within <git-ssh-server /> tag or provide
        them as references through attributes (acl-ref, user-dao-ref, user-dao-acl-ref) and then define them
        elsewhere in the document (with correspondent 'id' attribute). You can also define
        ACL, user DAO and server key pair outside <git-ssh-server /> tag and without 'id' attribute,
        and in this case they would be used by all git servers defined in this file automatically.

        In this example git URL (for localhost) would look like this:
            ssh://testuser@localhost:1122/testrepo.git

        If you want to create new repository, you can clone non existing repository:
            git clone ssh://testuser@localhost:1122/testrepo.git

        or create new repo locally (or you can use one you already have):
            git init testrepo
            cd testrepo
            vim testfile.txt
            git add testfile.txt
            git commit -m "initial commit"
        then you should add new origin:
            git remote add origin ssh://testuser@localhost:1122/testrepo.git
        and push it:
            git push origin master

        Please note, if you want user to be able to create new repositories, he should have 'Create' permission.

         detect changes to the file and reload it.

        You can also use database to store users, groups and repository ACL information.

        All you need to do is to provide your database connection information.
        All needed tables would be created automatically.

        At the moment I have tested it against MySql, but if you want to use another database and
        something is not working, then you can customize sql statements by providing sql-statements-file attribute.

        Please, don't forget to add JDBC driver to the classpath, when you are starting the server.
        For example:
          java -cp /path/to/my-database-driver.jar;scumd-VERSION.jar com.asolutions.scmsshd.runner.ScumdConfigurableRunner

            Supported values for event attribute:
                * authentication
                * authorization
                * repoCreate

        -->

        <!--
            And of course you can create your own listeners and add them as standard spring beans!

            Listener class is simple pojo that has methods for event handling like this:

                public void onEvent(AuthorizationFailEvent event) {}

            in this case it will be triggered only on AuthorizationFailEvent.
            You can have more than one handler method in the same class.

            You can annotate first parameter with following annotations
            in order to trigger listener before or after event (by default listener is triggered at Post stage):
                * com.asolutions.scmsshd.event.Pre
                * com.asolutions.scmsshd.event.Post

            here is an example:
                public void onEvent(@Pre AuthorizationEvent event) {
                    throw new CancelEventException("Nobody is allowed to access my precious repos!");
                }

            In @Pre events you can also throw com.asolutions.scmsshd.event.CancelEventException
            in order to cancel correspondent action.

            You can also define method that returns instance of 'Support' class.
            This will restrict listener triggering even more:

                public Support supports() {
                    return SupportBuilder.builder()
                            .repo("**/*.git", "private/*.git")
                            .not().user("userName")
                            .build();
                }
        -->
        <!--
        <beans:bean class="org.my.personal.SuperEventListener" />
        -->
    <!--
    </listeners>
    -->

    <!--
        If you are using email listeners, you should also define email-sender
        in order to define SMTP/SMTPS configuration
    -->
    <!--
    <email-sender host="my.host" port="465" protocol="smtps"
