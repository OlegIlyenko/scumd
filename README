  SCuMD

   	A pure Java sshd daemon for serving up of git over the native
   	protocol. SCuMD is based upon jgit (jgit.org) by Shawn Pearce.
   	
   	SCuMD has the following advantages:
   	
   	- Pure Java
   	- Can run as an unprivilaged user
   	- Does not require shell accounts
   	- Does not require os level ssh to be exposed
   	- Has a pluggable authentication and authorization layer which
   	  allows easy addition of any auth mechanisms (or multiple).

            == WARNINGS / CAVEATS              ==

- Repository rules fall under the same rules as jgit.

            == Missing Features                ==

To be useful to many there are quite a few things that need to go in.
Many of them are authentication /authorization extensions which are
quite simple to add. If anyone is interested, please contact me 
@ mr.gaffo @ gmail dot com.
